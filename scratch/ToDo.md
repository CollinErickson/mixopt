To do

* Global optimizer: multistart, GP, genetic/evolution

  * GP: fit. Run EI. Avoid infinite loop.

* README

* Better examples

* Boolean, integer?

* Evaluate groups at a time?

* constraints?

* tests: par, mixopt

* coorddesc with cts: repeating same output many times?

* make sure track all have same length

* coorddesc: seems to spend a lot of time not improving at end

* set max run time

* add stopping reason (maxeval, maxiter, maxtime, normal)

* optim over ordered/int should take larger steps if small ones are decreasing
