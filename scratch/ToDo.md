To do

* Global optimizer: multistart, GP, genetic/evolution

  * GP: fit. Run EI. Avoid infinite loop.

* README

* Better examples

* Boolean, integer?

* Evaluate groups at a time?

* constraints?

* tests: (check codecov to see what tests to add)

* coorddesc with cts: repeating same output many times?

* coorddesc: seems to spend a lot of time not improving at end

* set max run time

* add stopping reason (maxeval, maxiter, maxtime, normal)

* index line search

  - add more prints for verbose

* par: print wraparound for discrete

* check for NA, etc

* To have LHS-like starts for multistart, implement q on par and use instead
of sample.
